FAU graduate. Working in the field of Geomatics Engineering, Photogrammetry, GIS, computational and Data (spatial) analysis, remote sensing, Data Science ,
web development and Transportation Engineering, I am currently working towards getting licenses in the areas of Engineering, surveying, GIS, 
and other relevant areas of interest.

I not only bring knowledge from all my years of studies, I also bring experience in other areas such as programming, statistical analysis, open source GIS,
and transportation engineering. Looking forward to applying my knowledge, and all the tools that I have accumulated through many years of experience, into making valuable
products and providing valuable insights for companies
